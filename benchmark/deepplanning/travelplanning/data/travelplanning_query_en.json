I'd like you to help me plan the entire trip, including transportation, accommodation, attractions, and meals.\n\nLet’s start with transportation. For the outbound journey, I’d prefer a high-speed train or regular train departing between 6:00 AM and 7:00 AM, so I can arrive early and have more time to explore. For the return trip, the timing is more flexible—just schedule it according to the itinerary.\n\nFor accommodation, I don’t have any special requirements—just a comfortable two-star hotel will be fine. However, there’s one small request: the TV in the room must support screen mirroring, as I’d like to use the TV to watch something relaxing at night. By the way, there are two of us traveling, but we only need to book one room.\n\nRegarding attractions, I’m particularly interested in natural scenery spots in \"Shaoxing.\" I’ve heard the mountains and rivers there are beautiful—please help include these scenic areas in the itinerary. Also, I’ve heard that \"Shaoxing\" has quite a few free attractions. If possible, I’d like to visit those as well—saving some money would be great!\n\nAs for dining, I don’t have strict requirements. Just check what good local specialty restaurants are near the itinerary locations and recommend a few options.\n\nThat covers all my needs—I believe I’ve provided all the necessary information. Please go ahead and create a detailed travel plan for me. Thank you! November 12, 2025 is Wednesday",

Regarding transportation, I’d like the outbound train to depart between 11:00 AM and 3:00 PM—this timing works well so I don’t have to wake up too early or rush too late.  \n\nFor accommodation, I’d like to stay at a five-star hotel that ideally offers SPA services, so I can fully relax during the trip.  \n\nAs for sightseeing, I’m particularly interested in visiting places in Chongqing with historical and cultural significance. Since time is limited, please arrange for me the top-rated historical and cultural attraction—it seems definitely worth visiting. Also, I can’t miss Chongqing’s local cuisine! I’ve heard there are many great restaurants near 'Baysi Road Delicious Food Street'. Please select one restaurant in that area that offers a waiting area service, so I won’t have to wait around inconveniently.  \n\nThese are all my requirements—I believe I’ve provided sufficient information. Please go ahead and plan the itinerary for me directly without asking for further details! November 12, 2025 is Wednesday",

My budget is limited, so please help me find the cheapest branch they have and book a room there, there are two of us traveling, so we’ll need one rooms.\n\nBy the way, I have two small requests about meals! First, when visiting the 'Guangzhou Museum (Zhenhai Tower Exhibition Area)', could you help me find the nearby restaurant with the lowest average spending per person? I assume there should be plenty of options around there. Second, when I go to 'Flower City Square', I’ve heard there are some great restaurants on the must-try dining list. Please pick one that ranks in the top ten on that list and arrange a meal there—I’d love to taste some authentic local flavors.\n\nLastly, could you recommend some distinctive and worthwhile attractions in Guangzhou and help organize them into a well-planned itinerary? That covers all my needs. I believe I’ve provided enough information—please go ahead and plan out the full itinerary and budget for me! November 12, 2025 is Wednesday",

I really enjoy outdoor settings, so it would be great if the restaurant offers outdoor seating. By the way, when visiting 'Nanjing Museum', I’d also like to have a meal at the nearest restaurant to save time and make the itinerary more efficient.\n\nThat's basically all—I think I've provided enough information.

By the way, I’m traveling alone, so I only need one room.\n\nRegarding dining, I have two small requests. On one day, I’d like to find a restaurant near 'Tsinghua University', preferably one that offers a waiting area service so I don’t have to wait in line too long. Another time, when I’m near 'Sanlitun Taikoo Li', could you help me find the restaurant with the lowest average spending per person? That way, I can save a bit on food expenses.\n\nThose are basically all my requirements. I’ve provided all the necessary information, so feel free to arrange the full itinerary and budget directly without needing to ask me for further details. Thanks so much!
